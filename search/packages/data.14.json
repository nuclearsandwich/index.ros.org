The package implements a ROS node that uses\n    Bluetooth to communicate with the Wiimote device, obtaining accelerometer\n    and gyro data, the state of LEDs, the IR camera, rumble (vibrator),\n    buttons, joystick, and battery state. The node additionally enables ROS\n    nodes to control the Wiimote's LEDs and vibration for feedback to the human\n    Wiimote operator. LEDs and vibration may be switched on and off, or made to\n    operate according to a timed pattern.\n  ","maintainers":"Jonathan Bohren","authors":"Andreas Paepcke Melonee Wise Mark Horn","distro":"jade","instance":"github-ros-drivers-joystick_drivers","readme":""},{"id":2888,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/assimp_devel/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"assimp devel","name":"assimp_devel","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"assimp library","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2889,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/downward/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"downward","name":"downward","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"fast downward: PDDL Planner (http://www.fast-downward.org)","maintainers":"Yohei Kakiuchi","authors":"","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2890,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/ff/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"ff","name":"ff","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"ff: pddl planner. see http://www.loria.fr/~hoffmanj/ff.html","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"J.Hoffmann","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2891,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/ffha/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"ffha","name":"ffha","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"ffha: PDDL Planner (http://ipc.informatik.uni-freiburg.de)","maintainers":"Yohei Kakiuchi","authors":"","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2892,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/julius/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"julius","name":"julius","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"julius: Open-Source Large Vocabulary CSR Engine (http://julius.sourceforge.jp/index.php)","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2893,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/libcmt/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"libcmt","name":"libcmt","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"libCMT ROS Wrapper","maintainers":"Yuto Inagaki","authors":"","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2894,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/libsiftfast/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"libsiftfast","name":"libsiftfast","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"\n    Library to compute SIFT features\n  ","maintainers":"Kei Okada","authors":"zerofrog","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2895,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/lpg_planner/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"lpg planner","name":"lpg_planner","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"lpg_planner: LPGL Planner (http://zeus.ing.unibs.it/lpg/)","maintainers":"Hitoshi Kamada","authors":"Kei Okada Yuki Furuta Hitoshi Kamada","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2896,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/mini_maxwell/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"mini maxwell","name":"mini_maxwell","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"\n\n     mini_maxwell\n\n  ","maintainers":"Ryohei Ueda","authors":"Yusuke Furuta","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2897,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/nlopt/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"nlopt","name":"nlopt","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"\n    nlopt\n  ","maintainers":"Noda Shintaro","authors":"","distro":"jade","instance":"github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty","readme":""},{"id":2898,"baseurl":"","url":"/p/slic/github-jsk-ros-pkg-jsk_3rdparty#jade","last_commit_time":"2018-09-25","tags":"slic","name":"slic","repo_name":"jsk_3rdparty","released":"is:released","unreleased":"is:unreleased","version":"2.1.11","description":"SLIC-Superpizel ROS Wrapper\n  This file contains the class elements of the class Slic.
