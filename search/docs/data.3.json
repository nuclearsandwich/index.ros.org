config files and external configuration at run-time is forthcoming.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogger concepts¶\nLog messages have a severity level associated with them: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR or FATAL, in ascending order.\nA logger will only process log messages with severity at or higher than a specified level chosen for the logger.\nEach node (in rclcpp and rclpy) has a logger associated with it that automatically includes the node’s name and namespace.\nIf the node’s name is externally remapped to something other than what is defined in the source code, it will be reflected in the logger name.\nNon-node loggers can also be created that use a specific name.\nLogger names represent a hierarchy.\nIf the level of a logger named “abc.def” is unset, it will defer to the level of its parent named “abc”, and if that level is also unset, the default logger level will be used.\nWhen the level of logger “abc” is changed, all of its descendants (e.g. “abc.def”, “abc.ghi.jkl”) will have their level impacted unless their level has been explicitly set.\n\n\nLogging usage¶\nIn C++:\n\nSee the logging demo for example usage.\nSee the rclcpp documentation for an extensive list of functionality.\n\nIn Python:\n\nSee the rclpy examples for example usage of a node’s logger.\nSee the rclpy tests for example usage of keyword arguments (e.g. skip_first, once).\n\n\n\nLogger configuration¶\n\nCommand line configuration of the default severity level¶\nAs of the Bouncy ROS 2 release, the default severity level for loggers can be configured from the command line with the following, for example (the level string is not case sensitive):\nros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener __log_level:=debug\n\n\nThis will affect all loggers that have not explicitly been configured to use a particular severity level.\nConfiguration of specific loggers from the command line is forthcoming.\n\n\nProgrammatic configuration of individual loggers¶\nLogger configuration is still under development.\nFor now, the severity level of individual loggers can be configured programmatically with, e.g.:\nIn C++:\nrcutils_logging_set_logger_level(\"logger_name\", RCUTILS_LOG_SEVERITY_DEBUG);\n\n\nIn Python:\nlogger.set_level(rclpy.logging.LoggingSeverity.DEBUG)\nrclpy.logging.set_logger_level('logger_name', rclpy.logging.LoggingSeverity.DEBUG)\n\n\nThe logging demo provides an example of manually exposing a service so that loggers can be configured externally; in the future we expect runtime configuration capabilities of loggers to be exposed automatically.\n\n\n\nConsole output configuration¶\nBy default, console output will be formatted to include the message severity, logger name, and the message.\nInformation such as the file name, function name and line number of the log call are also available.\nCustom console output format can be configured with the RCUTILS_CONSOLE_OUTPUT_FORMAT environment variable: see the rcutils documentation for details.\nAs rclpy and rclcpp both use rcutils for logging, this will effect all Python and C++ nodes.\n\n\n"},{"id":13,"url":"/doc/ros2/Tutorials/catment/","title":"On the mixing of ament and catkin (catment)","content":"\nOn the mixing of ament and catkin (catment)¶\nAll that follows is experimental and speculative.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground\nPostulates\nUse cases, with experimental implementations\nAdding ROS packages to a ROS2 workspace and building with ament build\nBuilding ROS2 packages with catkin_make_isolated\nCombining all of ROS and ROS2 in one workspace and building it (TODO)\nUsing bloom to release ament packages (TODO)\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground¶\nThere once was a thing called rosbuild.\nThen came a thing called catkin, which largely replaced rosbuild.\nRecently introduced is a thing called ament, which may one day replace catkin.\nAll three tools can be considered “meta-build systems.”\nThey sit atop other build systems (e.g., CMake, Python setuptools) and provide extra functionality that’s intended to make those build systems easier to use, especially when managing dependencies across multiple packages and when building multiple packages in a single workspace.\nEach of these meta-build systems does two things:\n\nAdd API to the underlying build system (e.g,. CMake) that can be used to simplify common tasks (e.g., supplying all the flags exported by depended-upon packages when building an executable).\nThere are usually hooks to allow injection of extra API by packages outside of the core meta-build system.\nrosbuild: mk/cmake.mk, rosbuild_init(), rosbuild_add_executable(), etc.\ncatkin: catkin_package(), catkin_install_python(), etc.\nament: ament_target_dependencies(), ament_export_dependencies(), ament_package(), etc.\n\n\nProvide a tool that can be used to iterate in dependency order over a workspace full of packages, building and perhaps installing each one.\nrosbuild: rosmake\ncatkin: catkin build, catkin_make, catkin_make_isolated, etc.\nament: ament build\n\n\n\nThe common thread that ties all of these systems together is the division of the code into packages, with each package containing a manifest file (manifest.xml or package.xml).\nThis manifest is required (with some exceptions) for both parts of the meta-build system (API and building tool) to function.\n\n\nPostulates¶\n\nWhile we usually consider the two aspects of a meta-build system to be coupled, they needn’t be.\nThe API used inside a package and the tool that iterates over the packages can be considered largely independent, with the package manifest forming the interface between them.\nThere’s no reason in principle why, for example, rosmake couldn’t be modified to iterate over a workspace filled with catkin packages, stepping into them in dependency order and doing the usual mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make install routine for each one (with appropriate flags passed to cmake and make).\nThe effort required to migrate from one meta-build system to another should be minimized.\nThe mass migration from rosbuild to catkin was difficult and remains a sore point for many in the community.\nWhile it’s reasonable to ask developers to make changes in exchange for getting access to new functionality, the changes that are required should be as small as possible without sacrificing the effectiveness of the new system.\nThis is especially true when the old system is in widespread use.\nCorollary: Migration to a new meta-build system should not be required without a very good reason.\nIf a developer doesn’t want the functionality offered by the new system, then she shouldn’t be coerced into migrating from the old system unless there’s something irrevocably broken about the old system (e.g., rosbuild‘s in-source build pattern and lack of an “install” step).\n\n\nInteroperability is a good thing.\nWhenever possible (not all combinations will be practical), developers should be able to mix and match meta-build systems, including mixing their different aspects (i.e., use the building tool from one system and the API from another).\nSuch mixing and matching is especially important when developers want to combine a large existing code base using one meta-build system (e.g., ROS with catkin) with new libraries and tools offered by a code base using another meta-build system (e.g., ROS2 with ament).\nIdeally that kind of combination can be done without requiring changes to the API used by either code base and without telling the developer which builder tool to use.\nCorollary: Workspaces needn’t be homogeneous.\nThere’s no reason that we shouldn’t be able to freely mix, say, catkin and ament packages in one workspace, with dependencies going in both directions, so long as the builder tool in use knows how to build them both.\nThe primary interface between packages (at least, CMake-controlled packages) is their CMake configuration file.\nSo long as that configuration file follows the standard protocol (setting foo_LIBRARIES, etc.), then it shouldn’t matter who wrote the file.\nIt could be auto-generated by catkin or ament, or even manually crafted by a developer who wants to use plain CMake in her package, but still have that package depended-upon by catkin or ament packages.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse cases, with experimental implementations¶\n\nAdding ROS packages to a ROS2 workspace and building with ament build¶\nLet’s say that you want to add some existing ROS packages to your ROS2 workspace and don’t want to migrate the ROS packages from catkin to ament (or vice versa). Here are two patches that let you do that:\n\nament_package:\nAdd support for format 1 package manifests, instead of requiring format 2.\nThis change isn’t strictly related to catkin vs. ament, because format 2 has been around for a while and catkin supports it, so developers could already update their manifests to format 2.\nBut there’s a ton of ROS code out there that uses format 1, so we should support it.\nThis implementation could be improved, e.g., by reasoning over the various flavors of depend tags and how they differ between formats 1 and 2.\nament_tools:\nAdd a new catkin build type to ament.\nThis implementation just treats catkin packages the same as plain cmake packages, which seems to work fine.\nIt could be made more sophisticated.\n\nExample usage:\n\nGet the ROS2 code as usual, using the branches mentioned above.\nAdd to your workspace some catkin ROS packages, ensuring that all of their dependencies are satisfied (either also present in the workspace or installed elsewhere with appropriate setup shell files sourced).\nBuild as usual (e.g., ./src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.by build).\n\nVoila: your existing code isn’t suddenly broken just because there’s a new builder tool in use.\n\nVariation: Building ROS packages with ament build¶\nLet’s say that you love the new ament tool and want to use it to build your existing ROS packages that use catkin internally.\nHere’s an example of how to do that, by doing a minimal installation of ament and then using it to build a workspace full of ROS catkin packages:\nmkdir -p ~/ament_ws/src\ncd ~/ament_ws/src\ngit clone https://github.com/osrf/osrf_pycommon.git\ngit clone https://github.com/ament/ament_package.git\ncd ament_package\ngit checkout catkin\ncd ..\ngit clone https://github.com/ament/ament_tools.git\ncd ament_tools\ngit checkout catkin\ncd ../..\n ./src/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py build\n\n\nNow build the ROS packages:\n. $HOME/ament_ws/install/setup.bash\ncd ~/ros_catkin_ws\nament build\n\n\nVoila: you used the ament build tool to build your catkin packages, without having to migrate them.\n\n\nVariation: Using the catkin API in a ROS2 package¶\nLet’s say that you’re building on top of ROS2, which internally uses the ament API, and you want to add a new package using the catkin API.\nTo make this work, we need a Python3 installation of catkin (the binary debians use Python2.7).\nHere’s an example of doing that, installing to $HOME/catkin:\n# install catkin_pkg\ngit clone https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/catkin_pkg.git\ncd catkin_pkg\ngit checkout ament\npython3 setup.py install --prefix $HOME/catkin --single-version-externally-managed --record foo --install-layout deb\n# install catkin\ngit clone https://github.com/ros/catkin.git\ncd catkin\ngit checkout ament\nmkdir build\ncd build\nPYTHONPATH=$HOME/catkin/lib/python3/dist-packages/ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/catkin -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3\nmake install\n\n\nTo use that version of catkin, you just need to source the $HOME/catkin/setup.bash file.\nLet’s assume that you have the usual ROS2 workspace in ~/ros2_ws, and that you’re on the catkin branches in ament_package and ament_tools.\nAdd to that workspace the image_tools_catkin package from https://github.com/gerkey/catment.\nIt’s a simple port of the ROS2 image_tools package, taking it from the ament API to the catkin API.\nTo build it:\ncd ~/ros2_ws\n. $HOME/catkin/setup.bash\n./src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py build\n\n\nVoila: when adding new packages atop ROS2, you’re free to choose which CMake API you prefer inside your package.\n\nCaveat: I had to comment out the use of CATKIN_DEPENDS inside catkin_package(), because somewhere somebody was getting upset that things like rclcpp aren’t catkin packages.\nThat constraint needs to be relaxed somehow.\nTODO: The same demo but with a ament package that depends on a catkin package (this is easy).\nTODO: The same demo but with a package that has a vanilla CMakeLists.txt that uses neither ament nor catkin, and provides a manually generated fooConfig.cmake file that exports the right stuff to make it look the same to outsiders.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding ROS2 packages with catkin_make_isolated¶\nLet’s say that you’re already familiar with ROS and catkin and that you’re excited to try ROS2, but that you’re not in the mood to learn about ament.\nYou’d rather stick to what you know, such as using catkin_make_isolated to build everything.\nHere is a patch that allows you to do that:\n\ncatkin:\nAdd support for packages that declare themselves to have a build type of ament_*.\nThis implementation calls out to ament to build each such package.\nWhile ament_cmake packages can be treated as plain cmake packages (as we did when adding catkin support to ament), ament_python packages require some gnarly invocations of Python.\nInstead of trying to replicate that logic in catkin, it’s easier to just let ament handle it.\nAlso in this patch, we add the buildtool_export_depend packages to the set that are considered when building.\ncatkin_pkg:\nAlso in this patch, we add the buildtool_export_depend packages to the set that are considered when computing the topological order.\n\nBecause we’re going to call out to ament build, we will also need a minimal installation of ament, as did in a previous example:\nmkdir -p ~/ament_ws/src\ncd ~/ament_ws/src\ngit clone https://github.com/osrf/osrf_pycommon.git\ngit clone https://github.com/ament/ament_package.git\ncd ament_package\ngit checkout catkin\ncd ..\ngit clone https://github.com/ament/ament_tools.git\ncd ament_tools\ngit checkout catkin\ncd ../..\n ./src/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py build\n\n\nThen we need to install the modified version of catkin somewhere:\n# install catkin_pkg\ngit clone https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/catkin_pkg.git\ncd catkin_pkg\ngit checkout ament\npython3 setup.py install --prefix $HOME/catkin --single-version-externally-managed --record foo --install-layout deb\n# install catkin\ngit clone https://github.com/ros/catkin.git\ncd catkin\ngit checkout ament\nmkdir build\ncd build\nPYTHONPATH=$HOME/catkin/lib/python3/dist-packages/ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/catkin -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3\nmake install\n\n\nNow build the ROS2 packages:\n. $HOME/catkin/setup.bash\n. $HOME/ament_ws/install/setup.bash\ncd ~/ros2_ws\ntouch src/eProsima/AMENT_IGNORE\nPYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/gerkey/ros2_ws_catkin/install_isolated/lib/python3.5/site-packages catkin_make_isolated --install\n\n\nVoila: you’ve built ROS2 using the tools that you’re familiar with.\n\nCaveat: we’re ignoring the eProsima packages in the workspace because they lack package.xml files, which means that catkin can’t see them.\nament has some heuristics for handling such packages.\nOptions: backport those heuristics to catkin; switch to installing non-package.xml-containing packages outside of the workspace; or just add a package.xml to each of those packages (e.g., in our own fork).\n\n\n\nCombining all of ROS and ROS2 in one workspace and building it (TODO)¶\nThis step will require sorting out some things, including at least:\n\nPackage name conflicts.\nWe currently have ROS2 versions of ROS message packages, as well as some stuff in geometry2.\nEither the functionality needs to be merged into one package that can support both systems, or the new versions need different names.\nMessage generation.\nROS and ROS2 have different message generation steps, the output of which might or not might conflict.\nSomething sort of sophisticated needs to be done to allow generation of all the right artifacts from a single message package (or, as indicated above, the new message packages need different name).\n\n\n\nUsing bloom to release ament packages (TODO)¶\nIt seems like bloom ought be able to release packages that use the ament CMake API, and that the resulting releases should be able to be built on the farm.\nWe can make changes to bloom and ros_buildfarm as needed to enable this use case.\n\n\n\n"},{"id":14,"url":"/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Composition/","title":"Composing multiple nodes in a single process","content":"\nComposing multiple nodes in a single process¶\n\nTable of Contents\n\nROS 1 - Nodes vs. Nodelets\nROS 2 - Unified API\nWriting a Component\nUsing Components\nRun the demos\nRun-time composition using ROS services (1.) with a publisher and subscriber\nRun-time composition using ROS services (1.) with a server and client\nCompile-time composition using ROS services (2.)\nRun-time composition using dlopen\n\n\n\n\n\nROS 1 - Nodes vs. Nodelets¶\nIn ROS 1 you can write your code either as a ROS node or as a ROS nodelet.\nROS 1 nodes are being compiled into executables.\nROS 1 nodelets on the other hand are being compiled into a shared library which is then being loaded at runtime by a container process.\n\n\nROS 2 - Unified API¶\nIn ROS 2 the recommended way of writing your code is that of a nodelet - we call it a Component.\nThis enables to easily add common concepts to existing code, like a life cycle.\nThe biggest drawback of different APIs is being avoided in ROS 2 - both approaches can use the same API in ROS 2.\n\nIt will still be possible to use the node-like style of “writing your own main” but for the common case it is not recommended.\nBy making the process layout a deploy-time decision the user can choose between:\n\nrunning multiple nodes in separate processes with the benefits of process/fault isolation as well as easier debugging of individual nodes and\nrunning multiple nodes in a single process with the lower overhead and optionally more efficient communication (see Intra Process Communication).\n\nThe vision is that a future version of ros2 launch will support making these different deployments easily configurable.\n\n\nWriting a Component¶\nSince a component is only built into a shared library it doesn’t have a main function (see Talker source code).\nA component subclasses from rclcpp::Node.\nSince it is not in control of the thread it shouldn’t perform any long running or even blocking tasks in its constructor.\nInstead it can use timers to get periodic notification.\nAdditionally it can create publishers, subscribers, servers, and clients.\nAn important aspect of making such a class a component is that the class registers itself using the package class_loader (see last line in the source code).\nThis makes the component discoverable when its library is being loaded into a running process - it acts as kind of an entry point.\n\n\nUsing Components¶\nThe composition package contains a couple of different approaches how to use components.\nThe two most common ones are:\n\nYou start a generic container process (1) and call the ROS service load_node offered by the container.\nThe ROS service will then load the component specified by the passed package name and library name and start executing it within the running process.\nInstead of calling the ROS service programmatically you can also use a command line tool to invoke the ROS service with the passed command line arguments\nYou create a custom executable containing multiple nodes which are known at compile time.\nThis approach requires that each component has a header file (which is not strictly needed for the first case).\n\n\n\nRun the demos¶\nThe executables from the composition packages can be run with the following commands:\n\nRun-time composition using ROS services (1.) with a publisher and subscriber¶\nIn the first shell:\nros2 run composition api_composition\n\n\nIn the second shell (see talker source code):\nros2 run composition api_composition_cli composition composition::Talker\n\n\nNow the first shell should show a message that the component was loaded as well as repeated message for publishing a message.\nAnother command in the second shell (see listener source code):\nros2 run composition api_composition_cli composition composition::Listener\n\n\nNow the first shell should show repeated output for each received message.\n\nThe demo uses hardcoded topic names and therefore you can’t run api_composition twice.\nBut in general it would be possible to run to separate container processes and load the talker and listener into separate ones and they would still communicate with each other.\n\n\nRun-time composition using ROS services (1.) with a server and client¶\nThe example with a server and a client is very similar.\nIn the first shell:\nros2 run composition api_composition\n\n\nIn the second shell (see server and client source code):\nros2 run composition api_composition_cli composition composition::Server\nros2 run composition api_composition_cli composition composition::Client\n\n\nIn this case the client sends a request to the server, the server processes the request and replies with a response, and the client prints the received response.\n\n\nCompile-time composition using ROS services (2.)¶\nThis demos shows that the same shared libraries can be reused to compile a single executable running multiple components.\nThe executable contains all four components from above: talker and listener as well as server and client.\nIn the shell call (see source code):\nros2 run composition manual_composition\n\n\nThis should show repeated messages from both pairs, the talker and the listener as well as the server and the client.\n\n\nRun-time composition using dlopen¶\nThis demo presents an alternative to 1. by creating a generic container process and pass it explicitly the libraries to load without using ROS interfaces.\nThe process will open each library and create one instance of each “rclcpp::Node” class in the library source code).\nLinux In the shell call:\nros2 run composition dlopen_composition `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/libtalker_component.so `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/liblistener_component.so\n\n\nOSX In the shell call:\nros2 run composition dlopen_composition `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/libtalker_component.dylib `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/liblistener_component.dylib\n\n\nWindows In cmd.exe call\nros2 pkg prefix composition\n\n\nto get the path to where composition is installed. Then call\nros2 run composition dlopen_composition <path_to_composition_install>\\bin\\talker_component.dll <path_to_composition_install>\\bin\\listener_component.dll\n\n\nNow the shell should show repeated output for each sent and received message.\n\n\n\n"},{"id":15,"url":"/doc/ros2/Releases/Release-Howto/","title":"How to Release","content":"\nHow to Release¶\nThis page tries to capture the process we go through to make a new beta release of ROS 2.\nWe usually don’t branch before a release but “freeze” the used branch.\nDuring the testing phase make sure that no unwanted changes are being committed to that branch.\nIteratively test either using the artifacts produced by the packaging jobs or from-source builds and make necessary changes.\nOnce the current state is ready to be released, follow these steps:\n\nGet a fresh copy of all repositories using the master ros2.repos file.\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/master/ros2.repos | vcs import ./src\n\n\nUpdate the version number in (most) packages (excluding the ones which have their own numbering scheme).
